Files, Masks, and Plotting

It took a while to figure out how to handle bad data
and to figure out where the bad data was
also I took some time to learn masked arrays better
What I tried to do was only use data that was good
so lines that had missing fields were not included 
in the temperatures or julian days

Anyways, I think the results were good, at the very least
